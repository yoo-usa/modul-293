// Spaces are defined on this place.
// You can use them in your scss files with the function space.set().
// You can decouple the space definition here from the base-font-size,
// or you can bind it to the base-font-size by using the font.$base-size variable.
// Make sure you define the space Variables $base-space and $base-space-px in
// a way it makes sense for your project. (it should end in the same result)

// Information: Why is here also a px value defined? ->
// In some cases you have to use a representation as Pixel value, as example
// when you use the space value in a calculation with other Values or if you try to use
// spaces for PDF print generation.

$base-space: 1rem;
$base-space-px: 10px;
